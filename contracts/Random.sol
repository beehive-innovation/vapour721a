    /// Implements a modified fisher yates algorithm to report a single result
    /// of a shuffle at position `n_` out of `max_`.
    ///
    /// Modifications:
    /// - We leave the initial allocation of the array as 0 values and use the
    ///   index of the internal shuffle iterations as the values to write. This
    ///   avoids an additional initial O(n) operation to prepopulate the array,
    ///   it also means we only support sequential arrays from [0,max].
    /// - We don't read or write the values that we draw from the side of the
    ///   swap that can't possibly be subsequently written to `n_`.
    /// - We stop processing the shuffle as soon as we know the value for `n_`.
    ///
    /// Each index is represented as a single byte so the micro lottery values
    /// cannot exceed `type(uint8).max`.
    ///
    /// Gas cost is `~230 * (max_ - n_)` so it is `O(n)` but lower ID values
    /// will pay more gas due to the lazy calculation of higher IDs. Worst case
    /// gas cost for the largest possible micro lottery and ID 0 is therefore
    /// about ~60 000 gas. Note however that memory expansion costs in the evm
    /// are non-linear past ~720 bytes, so if a function call is shuffling
    /// AND using other memory, it may incur substantial costs above the base
    /// cost due to the allocation of bytes needed to calculate the shuffle.
    /// The shuffle algorithm needs to allocate 1 byte for each ID + 32 bytes
    /// for the length slot of the bytes array.
    ///
    /// A possible NFT minting workflow for the microLottery:
    /// - Users reserve a sequential ID for themselves
    /// - A seed is generated somehow
    /// - Users mint an NFT for themselves where the NFT ID is the output of
    ///   their reserved ID as `n_` and everyone uses the same seed
    ///
    /// Using the above workflow, users pay the gas cost for their own ID
    /// shuffling, which is potentially more decentralised than a single user
    /// being responsible for shuffling. OTOH the total gas cost across all
    /// users is likely much higher than a single shuffle because every user
    /// must calculate _their_ shuffle, which includes all higher ID shuffles.
    /// This is simply how fisher yates works, and seems unavoidable without
    /// finding a different shuffle algorithm.
    ///
    /// One benefit of the micro lottery approach is that it can be exposed by
    /// the implementing contract as a "preview" public function, where it can
    /// be called offchain to inspect any ID for any seed without paying gas.
